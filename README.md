<h3>Welcome to my and <a href="https://github.com/orabu103">Or Abuhazira</a> Project</h3>

<h3>About the program</h3>
developed a basic Chat application in Java. It consists of a server and multiple client. The server continually monitors for incoming messages and broadcasts them to all the clients. The client is made up of a Swing GUI with a text area (for messages sent by the server and other clients), a text field (to send Text messages) and a button (SEND) and a button how is online(for see list of connected users). The client also continually monitors for incoming messages from other clients (via the Server). This is achieved with Threads and Event Listeners and the application works as expected.

<h3>About the server:</h3>
The server receives a port from an end greater than 1023 and then opens with the inserted port.
Also in the server window is detailed who logged in or logged out of the server, and also who sent the message.

<h3>About the clinet:</h3>
The client inserts an IP address that has been set as localhost that can be changed and also inserts a port that matches the server.
Then a user window opens that lists all who are logged on, cleaning chat.
The client sends a message to the server with the user's name and the sender sends the message to the other users.
Each client can send a private message to another user.
In addition, the message window appears if the client has joined or left the chat and in each updated message the message is sent.
