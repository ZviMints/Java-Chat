<h3>About the clinet:</h3>
</br>
The client inserts an IP address that has been set as localhost that can be changed and also inserts a port that matches the server.
Then a user window opens that lists all who are logged on, cleaning chat.
The client sends a message to the server with the user's name and the sender sends the message to the other users.
Each client can send a private message to another user.
In addition, the message window appears if the client has joined or left the chat and in each updated message the message is sent.
