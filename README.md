<h3>About the program</h3>

The purpose of the program is to produce chat that is used to send messages between clients, Using a server.
<br>
SERVER-
</br>
The server receives a port from an end greater than 1023 and then opens with the inserted port.
</br>
Also in the server window is detailed who logged in or logged out of the server, and also who sent the message.
</br>
CLINET-
</br>
The client inserts an IP address that has been set as localhost that can be changed and also inserts a port that matches the server.
</br>
Then a user window opens that lists all who are logged on, cleaning chat.
</br>
The client sends a message to the server with the user's name and the sender sends the message to the other users.
</br>
Each client can send a private message to another user.
</br>
In addition, the message window appears if the client has joined or left the chat and in each updated message the message is sent.
